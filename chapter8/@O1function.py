# 1. Built-in Functions
# These are pre-defined functions provided by a programming language or its libraries. They are ready to use without requiring you to define them yourself.

# Examples in Python:
# print(): Displays output.
# len(): Returns the length of a sequence.
# abs(): Returns the absolute value of a number.
# sorted(): Returns a sorted version of a list.





# User-Defined Functions
# These are custom functions created by programmers to perform specific tasks not covered by built-in functions.

# Defining a user-defined function
# def add_numbers(a, b):
#     return a + b

# # Using the function
# result = add_numbers(5, 3)
# print("Sum:", result)
